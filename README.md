# EventBus
The EventBus (eventbus.org) is advanced publish/subscribe (pub/sub) library for Java
with an emphasis on simplicity, generics, annotations and customizability.  

The EventBus supports String-based topic subscriptions and Class-based type 
subscriptions, including support for subscribing to generic types, e.g., 
subscriptions to List<Customer> separately from List<Order>.
